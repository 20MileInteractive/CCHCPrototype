			<h3>Meet Our Liaisons</h3>
			<p>
		From physician and specialist recommendations to helping you navigate our health system, the Lightkeeper’s Society Liaison will make every effort to accommodate your healthcare needs. This includes providing you with personal assistance during an emergency situation. Should you or an immediate family member require medical attention, the Liaison will meet you and your family in the emergency departments of Cape Cod Hospital and Falmouth Hospital, offering support and guidance, as well as advocate on your behalf with hospital personnel, if needed.
